# codellama-python
This is a PoC about integrating docker + codellama + python in order to apply code review in the pre-commit git hook

# How it works
- First you should serve `ollama` using docker `docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama` .
- Clone this project and move inside it.
- Create the following file `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
```
  #!/bin/sh

# Find all modified Python files
FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.py$')

if [ -z "$FILES" ]; then
  echo "No Python files to check."
  exit 0
fi

# Clean the review.md file before starting
> review.md

# Review each modified Python file
for FILE in $FILES; do
  content=$(cat "$FILE")
  prompt="\n Review this code, provide suggestions for improvement, coding best practices, improve readability, and maintainability. Remove any code smells and anti-patterns. Provide code examples for your suggestion. Respond in markdown format. If the file does not have any code or does not need any changes, say 'No changes needed'."
  
  # get model review suggestions
  suggestions=$(docker exec ollama ollama run codellama "Code: $content $prompt")
  
  # AÃ±adir el prefijo del nombre del archivo y las sugerencias al archivo review.md
  echo "## Review for $FILE" >> review.md
  echo "" >> review.md
  echo "$suggestions" >> review.md
  echo "" >> review.md
  echo "---" >> review.md
  echo "" >> review.md
done

echo "All Python files were applied the code review."
exit 0
```
- Add or modify the python files.
- Apply a commit message and wait for the review. I could take some minutes, the final result is a review.md with all suggestions from codellama.


#### Running with Docker

For the Docker container that runs the Flask server, the `requirements.txt` file should include the Flask library and any other dependencies your application needs. Given the context of the example, you would minimally need Flask and possibly the `requests` and `flask-cors` libraries if you're making HTTP requests or handling cross-origin resource sharing.

Here's a basic example of what your `requirements.txt` might look like:

```txt
Flask
requests
flask-cors
```

This assumes that your Flask server is using the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and `flask-cors` to handle any CORS issues. If there are additional libraries your application requires, make sure to list them here.

### Sample `requirements.txt`:

```txt
Flask
requests
flask-cors
```

### Full Docker Setup

For completeness, here is the entire setup:

#### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.11

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 11434 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 11434

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=11434"]
```

#### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  codellama:
    image: ollama/ollama
    volumes:
      - ollama:/root/.ollama
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"

  flask-server:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "11435:11434"
    depends_on:
      - codellama

volumes:
  ollama:
```

#### .git/hooks/pre-commit

Make sure the pre-commit hook script is updated to use the correct port for the Flask server.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Find all modified Python files
FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.py$')

if [ -z "$FILES" ]; then
  echo "No Python files to check."
  exit 0
fi

# Clean the review.md file before starting
> review.md

# Review each modified Python file
for FILE in $FILES; do
  content=$(cat "$FILE")
  prompt="\n Review this code, provide suggestions for improvement, coding best practices, improve readability, and maintainability. Remove any code smells and anti-patterns. Provide code examples for your suggestion. Respond in markdown format. If the file does not have any code or does not need any changes, say 'No changes needed'."

  # Send request to the running Docker container and get suggestions
  response=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:11435/review -d "$content")
  
  # Extract suggestions from JSON response
  suggestions=$(echo $response | jq -r '.suggestions')

  # Add the file name prefix and suggestions to the review.md file
  echo "## Review for $FILE" >> review.md
  echo "" >> review.md
  echo "$suggestions" >> review.md
  echo "" >> review.md
  echo "---" >> review.md
  echo "" >> review.md
done

echo "All Python files were applied the code review."
exit 0
```

### Steps to Run

1. **Build the Docker containers:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose build
    ```

2. **Run the Docker containers:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. **Modify your Python files and commit the changes to trigger the pre-commit hook.**

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Test code review in pre-commit hook"
    ```
